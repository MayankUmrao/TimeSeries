# TimeSeries
Time Series Forecasting of Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Electricity Generation in USA.


•	Predicted Co2 Emissions in USA for next 6 months using time series techniques. 
•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify Seasonality, Trend and Stationarity in data.
•	Statistically tested for stationarity, trend and seasonality using ADF-test, KPSS-test & Decompose Plot. 
•	Transformed dataset using box-cox transformation and decomposed the time series using STL and SEATS.
•	Applied Holt Winter’s Additive Model and SARIMA model for forecasting the emission, with p,d,q values being inferred using PACF and ACF test and plots.
•	Fine-tuned the parameters using Grid Search and evaluated performance using RMSE, MAPE and Residual analysis.
•	Among all the models applied the Holt’s Winter Model gave best predictions with RMSE value of 6.0242.
